# ZeroGuess AI — Manufacturing AI Education Platform

> ZeroGuess AI is an education platform for manufacturing AI. Learn to build AI agents that analyze factory data, optimize production, and solve real manufacturing challenges — with a live factory simulation.

## What is ZeroGuess AI?

ZeroGuess AI is a manufacturing AI education platform by Tobias Lante. It provides hands-on learning experiences for engineers, developers, and students who want to understand how AI works in manufacturing environments. The flagship product is OpenShopFloor — a free Manufacturing AI Playground.

## Products

### OpenShopFloor — Manufacturing AI Playground
A free, hands-on playground for building and testing AI agents against a live manufacturing simulation. Features include 111 MCP tools, real-time factory data (OEE, stock, orders, quality, energy), pre-built AI agents, 6 gamified challenges, a visual flow editor, and a chat interface with tool visualization.

## Challenges

1. **OEE Champion** (Beginner): Achieve OEE > 85% across all machines for 24 simulated hours
2. **Zero Delay** (Intermediate): Ensure zero late deliveries over 48 simulated hours
3. **Lean Inventory** (Intermediate): Reduce inventory costs by 20% with zero stockouts
4. **Quality First** (Advanced): Achieve Cpk > 1.33 on all characteristics, resolve all SPC alarms
5. **Energy Saver** (Beginner): Reduce kWh per part by 15% over 24 simulated hours
6. **Full Auto** (Expert): Keep the factory running autonomously for 72 simulated hours

## Factory Simulation

The live factory simulation includes:
- 8 CNC machines and injection molding stations
- Assembly lines and quality inspection
- Real-time OEE, stock levels, order tracking
- 111 MCP tools across 6 servers (ERP, WMS, QMS, OEE, TMS, Knowledge Graph)
- 24/7 operation with realistic production patterns

## Technology

- **MCP Tools**: 111 tools across 6 MCP servers for querying factory data
- **AI Agents**: Chat-based agents with tool calling for manufacturing analysis
- **Visual Flows**: Node-RED-based drag-and-drop AI workflow editor
- **Stack**: TypeScript, Next.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MicroK8s
- **LLM**: Platform-provided LLM or bring your own (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)

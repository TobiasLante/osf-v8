# ZeroGuess AI — Manufacturing AI Education Platform (Full Documentation)

## Overview

ZeroGuess AI is a manufacturing AI education platform created by Tobias Lante. It provides hands-on learning experiences for engineers, developers, and students who want to understand how AI works in manufacturing environments.

The platform centers around OpenShopFloor — a free Manufacturing AI Playground that connects to a live factory simulation running 24/7. Users can chat with AI agents that have access to real-time factory data, build visual AI workflows, and complete gamified manufacturing challenges.

## Mission

Manufacturing AI is hard to learn because you need a factory to practice on. ZeroGuess AI solves this by providing a live factory simulation with 111 AI tools, so anyone can learn manufacturing AI without needing factory access, NDAs, or expensive infrastructure.

## OpenShopFloor — The Playground

### What It Is
OpenShopFloor is a free web-based Manufacturing AI Playground. It connects to a live factory simulation and provides AI agents, visual flow editors, and gamified challenges for learning manufacturing AI.

### Key Features

#### 1. Live Factory Simulation
A full manufacturing simulation runs 24/7 with:
- 8 CNC machines (9001-9018)
- 5 injection molding stations (SGM-001 to SGM-005)
- Assembly lines
- Quality inspection stations
- Tool management
- Real-time OEE calculation
- Order tracking and scheduling
- Stock/inventory management
- Energy monitoring

#### 2. 111 MCP Tools
The factory data is exposed through 6 MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers:
- **ERP Server** (mcp-erp): Orders, materials, scheduling, customer data
- **Manufacturing Server** (mcp-fertigung): Machine status, production history, capacity
- **QMS Server** (mcp-qms): Quality inspections, SPC data, Cpk values, calibration
- **WMS Server** (mcp-wms): Stock levels, warehouse movements, purchase orders
- **TMS Server**: Tool inventory, tool life, maintenance schedules
- **Knowledge Graph Server**: Dependency analysis, impact analysis

Each MCP server provides 15-20 tools that AI agents can call to query factory data.

#### 3. AI Chat Interface
Users can chat with an AI agent that has access to all 111 MCP tools. The agent can:
- Query real-time factory data (OEE, stock, orders, quality)
- Analyze production patterns
- Identify bottlenecks and risks
- Suggest optimizations
- Execute multi-step analyses

#### 4. Visual Flow Editor
A Node-RED-based drag-and-drop editor for building AI workflows:
- Connect MCP tools, LLMs, and decision logic visually
- Run flows against live factory data
- Inspect every step's output
- No coding required

#### 5. AI Agents Marketplace
Pre-built agents for common manufacturing tasks:
- OEE Monitor & Diagnostics
- Material & Capacity Planning
- Delivery Risk & Quality Guard
- Energy Optimizer
- Strategic Planner

#### 6. Gamified Challenges

## About the Creator

**Tobias Lante** is a manufacturing technology specialist who built ZeroGuess AI as an independent education project. After years in manufacturing consulting, he was frustrated by the barriers to learning manufacturing AI — NDAs, IT delays, lack of real data. He built a complete factory simulation so anyone can learn manufacturing AI by doing.
